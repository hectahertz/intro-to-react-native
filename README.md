# Materials for my Introduction to React Native Workshop

## Environment setup

### Basic requirements
If you just want to run apps through Expo on your physical device, these will be enough:

* [Brew](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
* [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) (recommended way: `brew install watchman`)
* [create-react-native-app](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) (recommended way: `npm install -g create-react-native-app`)

### To run apps in an emulator
If you also want to run apps through Expo in an emulator, you'll need to set it up

* iOS Emulator: Install Xcode [via the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
* Android Emulator: Follow the [Android development environment instructions for React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#android-development-environment)
